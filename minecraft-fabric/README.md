# Fabric Template

Automatically downloads and installs [fabric loader](https://fabricmc.net/)'s server.  
After clicking install, you can install mods by uploading them to the `mods` folder.  
You should install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/) before adding any mods.
