## Arma 3 Template

* This template requires credentials for a Steam account which has purchased the game.
* Please reference https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Startup_Parameters on how to input the strings for the startup parameters in the 'edit' section of the server.
* **Stop and Kill DO NOT work at the moment. This will be fixed in later versions of PufferPanel.** 
* To kill this server, you need to use something like `htop` and send a sigterm to the arma server.
