## Starbound Script
* This script is fairly straightforward to get a server up, just input 
your info and click install on the Server Control Page.
* You MUST use a valid steam username that owns Starbound in order to 
install the server.
* When you run the installer, you will enter your password into the 
console and answer the Steamguard interactively.
